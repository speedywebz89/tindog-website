TinDog Starting Files
Though this is not an actual website, it was a fun concept to build. This website idea and concept came from Dr. Angela Yus Web Development bootcamp. This was a fun website to build and really helped me with more advanced CSS concepts. I added my own touches through out the process of building this website which made it more fun.
Framworks used-Bootstrap 5.1

This website is made responsive using bootstrap and CSS media queries. Its best design will be on a desktop or larger viewport.
